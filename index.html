                    <li>There is a correlation between lake volume and maximum depth. This is not the case with lake volume and area. Lake Victoria, for example, has a large surface area but contains a small volume of water and is quite shallow. </li>
                    <li>Most of the deep lakes are rift lakes, forming at tectonic plate boundaries.</li>
                    <li>These large lakes are often grouped together. The Great Lakes, the East African Rift lakes, and the Russian lakes near Saint Petersburg are 3 notable examples of this phenomenon. </li>
                    <li>The Caspian Sea has by far the largest area and volume of any lake.</li>
                    <li>North America contains nine of the twenty largest lakes by area, including all five Great Lakes.</li>
